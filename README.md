## Description
This app allows the user to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE categories, products, and tags from a database. This is very useful for ecommerce sites, as they can update information on products as it occurs. 

## Usage
To use, the user should install the necessary files, then install dependencies. They should then create the database, then seed it. Then, the user can use an app such as Postman or InsomniaCore to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.

## Installation
To install dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm i
```
